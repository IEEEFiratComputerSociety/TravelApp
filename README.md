# TravelApp
We started this project during the pandemic period. We launched an application where people can meet and see many places in 81 provinces in times when our desire to travel will never end when everyone is bored at home.
This project was developed in Android studio using Java language.
In the project, we have developed both an informative part and two separate interfaces that users can use like social media. We have compiled these two parts in detail so that users can use them more easily.

### I Wandered Screen
. On this screen, first of all, our users will be able to see the places we have added and after a certain period, our users will be able to add them. \
. At first, on the screen, the user chooses what kind of place she wants to go to, then the city options appear. \
. Informative pages appear according to the category and city selected by the user. 

### Saw Screen
. Here is a screen where the user can share what he sees. \
. There is a screen where they can follow and like, favorite and message. 

### Profile Screen
. Here is a screen where the user can view favorites, saves and incoming messages. \
. It is a screen where he can edit his biography.
